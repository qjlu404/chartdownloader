make sure you have python3 and pip installed.
You may need to manually install the modules: `urllib3 lxml wheel wget pdf2image`.
 Run main.py and the rest is pretty straightfoward. 
 
 If you're on linux/mac you'll have to install Poppler manually.
 
 if you have github click the star button as a thank you :)
