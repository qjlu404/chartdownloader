currently in early stages.
currently it can only fetch links along with their name.

make sure you have python3 and pip installed.
type `pip install urllib3 lxml wheel wget pdf2image` or replace pip with pip3 if it doesnt work the first time in the command prompt
then go to the same directory as the python script and type `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` or any way that works for you.
